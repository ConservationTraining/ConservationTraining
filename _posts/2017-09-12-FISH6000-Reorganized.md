Hi gang. As per my email earlier today you'll notice that I've rearranged FISH 6000 so that the Proposal lecture now takes place in Week 3. My rationale is simple: The internal NSERC application deadline is Oct 13, so moving our proposal lecture earlier allows us to accomodate that.

This means in week 2 you should already be thinking of which scholarship or grant you will apply for, so that you can begin writing in week 3. Note that you will have only a couple days to write the proposal before showing a rough draft to a peer later that week.
