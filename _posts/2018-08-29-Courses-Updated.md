Hi everyone. The Fall 2018 semester is upon us. Please make sure you're properly registered for all courses in the upcoming semester.

I have updated the syllabus for 6000, 6001, and 6002. Note that I will be updating the course content as we roll through. As the semester proceeds I will be updating weekly slides - please make sure you're working from the most recent ones when coming to class.

Also - I rarely use this announcements page, so please don't rely on it for regular communication.

Looking forward to a great academic year!
