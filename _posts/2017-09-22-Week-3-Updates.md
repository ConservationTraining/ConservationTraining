A few updates:

* No lectures for FISH 6001 next week because Arnault had to be in the field. There will be an additional two hour lecture on Thursday Oct 5 to compensate.
* FISH 6000 slides are up. Please come prepared to start working on a proposal for a grant or scholarship, as we discussed.
* I wasn't quite able to get the FISH 6002 lecture done this week. I will post it Monday before class.
