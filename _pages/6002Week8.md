This week we will continue our exploration of graph-making in R. 

This week we will focus on the basics of making a plot publication-quality.

### Lecture Topics
* What makes a plot publication-quality?
* Fixing axes, reordering factors, considering data-density
* Figure captions
* Exporting for publication 
* Doing all of the above in both ggplot and base

### Resources

The most important resource this week is the [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

The PACE system can be [accessed at this link](https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/)

## Activities

Within the R project there is an analysis file with basic code for a couple of plots. In-class (not for marks) you will make one of these publication-quality.
