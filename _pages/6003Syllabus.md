# Statistics and Study Design for Fisheries

- **Instructor:** [Dr. Brett Favaro](http://about.me/brettfavaro)
- **Times:** Mondays 0900-0950, W2041, Tuesdays 0900-1050, W1003
- **Office Hours:** Thursday 0900-1200, W2009

*preamble TBD*

# Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will develop a working competency of R Statistical Software, and will be introduced to the software environment that fisheries scientists must master. Great importance will be placed on fostering the ability to self-teach and stay abreast of developments in data collection, management, display, and programming.

The fundmental competencies that you will develop in this course is:
* Able to design a statistically powerful study
* Able to define, build, and run an appropriate model for a dataset, using R Statistical Software
* Understand regression-type analysis ranging from simple (single linear regression) to complex (generalized linear mixed effects models) and how to apply them
* Use power analysis to determine the size of study needed
* Understand and apply meta-analysis to data 

We will focus extensively on lineral models due to their ubiquity in the life sciences, and their ability to be applied to many relevant situations within fisheries. 

# Expectations and Aspirations

Statistics can be intimidating, but that doesn't need to be the case. This class will dymystify common statistical techniques that are relevant to pretty much anyone in fisheries science, and will help you learn how to do them yourself in R. We will start with the fundamentals and conclude with some fairly advanced analysis. We will focus on statistical principles, such that you are empowered to self-study and learn new techniques after the class is over. 

My expectations are that you engage meaningfully with the course material. Come in and do your best, and 

# Course Structure

The course will meet twice weekly - one 1-hr block and one 2-hr block. Lectures will balance theory and practice, and there will be in-class activities.

# Course Policies 

## Social Media
Students are welcome to tweet about the course using the hashtag #MIStats - but the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule%20) is in effect. That means you **may not reveal the identity of the person speaking** in your tweets without their express permission. We want to encourage people to actively participate and make mistakes without fear of their mishaps being broadcast across the world. 

## Code of Conduct
You have the right to expect a supportive, safe environment in this course. This course will be governed by my [Fisheries Science Code of Conduct](/courses/coursesCodeofConduct), which all participants are expected to respect.

## Digital Competency
Students are expected to have basic computer competency. You should be able to operate Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, or equivalent (e.g. [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) or [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)). You should be able to download and install software onto your computer. Please install [R Statistical Software](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) prior to begining the course. 

If you lack these skills, please consult [training materials](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/training.aspx) on your own time. **Please bring a laptop to every class.**

Students should be proficient with R Statistical Software. Normally, students will have completed [FISH 6002](https://mifisheriesscience.github.io/courses/6002Data/) or equivalent training prior to starting FISH 6003. FISH 6002 is not a formal pre-requisite - you may demonstrate R competency in other ways.

## E-mail Policy
E-mail is not a primary tool for communication in this class. If you have questions about course content, your order of operation should be: 

1. Check the syllabus
2. Ask in class, or discuss with colleagues
3. Ask on Slack (this way, everyone can benefit from an answer)
4. Request a meeting with me (normally, to be held during office hours)

If emailing me a meeting request, use the subject line "FISH 6003: Meeting request." Please indicate three potential meeting times (Start with my office hours. Only if those don't work, propose alternatives) and explain in 1-3 lines what you want to meet about. 

E-mail is impersonal, burdeonsome, and adds to confusion, so let's minimize it. 

## Class Participation
There will be a LOT going on in this class. Most assignments are designed to be completed mostly in-class time. The class is highly collaborative, meaning you need to be present to do it. 

Accomodations will be made for serious illness or other extenuating circumstances. However, it is the student's responsibility to stay caught up with course materials - and missing in-class activities will result in a decreased participation grade.

So please, don't make it part of your plan to miss class! 

## Academic Honesty
This course is governed by MUN's [regulations on academic misconduct](http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748).
