In this week, we will pull together everything we have done in this class: Data collection, management, AND display, and integrate these skills to produce interactive plots.

We will do this using Shiny, an R package that specializes in this functionality

### Lecture Topics

* Why make an interactive plot?
* Introduction to Shiny
* Minimal examples - one-file and two-file
* Integrating interactive plots into RMarkdown
* Real-world example: The Cod Rebuilder
