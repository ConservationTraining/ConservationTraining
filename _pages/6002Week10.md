## November 6 and 7, 2017

Graphs and figures are not exclusive to science. They are used widely in general society as well. This week, we will explore a variety of examples of good and bad data visualization, to get a sense of how figures are used in general communication. 

### Lecture Topics

* The basics of #dataviz
* Scaling Y axes	
* Good and interesting plots versus bad plots
* Common causes of bad plots

### Resources

* [Reddit: Data is ugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/)

# In-class activities

* M: Time will be provided to work on the Major Project.

* T: Working in pairs or groups of 3, hand-draw alternative plots from above, present to class
