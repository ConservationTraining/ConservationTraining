10% of your course grade is earned by participation. Just show up, be yourself, and participate!

The remainder will be earned by completing assignments. These fall into three categories:

- Presentation on a special topic (20%)
- Major assignment (50%)
- Minor assignments (20%)

This document outlines the details and grading criteria for each assignment.

# Presentation on a special topic

We will cover a lot of ground on this course, but it is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg that respresents the whole of possible approaches used to quanitatively assess data. In this presentation, students will identify a statistical technique that we will not be covering as part of the core course. 

Students will teach us about the technique - what it is used for, why it is useful, how to use it, and how to assess its validity. Students will produce a 10-15 minute presentation.

## Deliverable:
Prepare a 10-15 minute presentation (plus 5-10 minutes for audience questions) that accomplishes these objectives:

1. Describe the statistical technique. What does it do? What is it for?
2. How do you assess the fit of this technique with your data? How can you tell if it worked or not?
3. Show an example of the technique used in a scientific paper
4. Demonstrate how to use the technique and interpret its results, with real or simulated data
	* This should be a worked example, with fully commented R code that explains what is being done at each step
5. Share **reproducible** R code with the class

Code that is shared for this assignment must be fully reproducible, extensively commented, and contained within an R project. 

## Timeline

By Week 3: Select topic. Review with instructor. Determine presentation schedule.

Starting Week 7: Present. One presenter per week.

## Grading scheme:

## Part 1: The presentation

The presentation is worth 30/40 marks of the assignment grade, and will be assessed as follows:

#### Describe the statistical technique. What does it do? What is it for? 
**Value: /10**
- Statistical technique should be clearly and accurately described. Literature explaining the technique is cited.
- Demonstrate deep understanding of the technique. Description is not superficial. Student constructively engages with questions on the topic.
- Contrast this technique with other methods. What does it add that would be missed with something simpler? How is it better than something more complex?

#### How do you assess the fit of this technique with your data? How can you tell if it worked or not?
**Value: /10**
- Any diagnostic plot techniques are explained
- An example of the statistical technique not working, and the technique working properly, are demonstrated
- This may be expressed as a checklist. What steps should be followed to ensure that the output of the technique is valid?

#### Show an example of the technique used in a scientific paper
**Value: /5**
- Correctly identify this technique in a paper
- Explain WHY the technique was used, and describe the data on which the technique was applied
- The results and output are explained, along with any diagnostic figures
- The results are interpreted. They found X - how did it allow them to conclude Y?

#### Demonstrate how to use the technique and interpret its results, with real or simulated data
**Value: /5**
- Show how to implement this technique in R. Present R code that you have written for Part 2.

## Part 2: A reproducible example
The remaining 10/40 marks will be based on assessment of R code that students write, which will demonstrate how to use the technique in R. This may be done with real data (i.e. taken from a paper) or simulated data. 

Note that many techniques or packages come with worked examples. It is not sufficient to just copy the exact example included with the package. While you may be writing code that is pre-packaged, you should apply the technique to different data, even if you just make up imaginary data yourself.

#### A worked example, with reproducible, fully commented R code that explains what is being done at each step
**Value: /10**
- Code is organized into an R project (see [https://mifisheriesscience.github.io/courses/6002Data/6002Week11/](https://mifisheriesscience.github.io/courses/6002Data/6002Week11/)) 
- Code is fully reproducible (i.e. anyone can open the project and run it without changing any code).
- Code is well-commented, organized, and easy to follow

## How to Submit

The presentation will take place in-class, on a Tuesday. Students should create a zip file contianing all sub-folders of their R project. The Zip file should be emailed to the course instructor **on or before the day of the presentation**.

## Value: 20% of course grade

# Major Assignment
 
In the Major Assignment, you will conduct a statistical analysis based on data you obtain. These data may be something that you have collected yourself for your research, from a public database, or as attached by another publication.

Essentially, the major assignment is to write the 'statistical analysis' part of the methods and results section of a publication-quality paper.
 
## Part 1: Obtaining and Describing Data

The goal of part 1 is to obtain and describe data. Key questions, which will be answered in two pages or less (single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman):
- Where are the data from?
- What are the data? (i.e. how many points? What are they measuring? How are they measured?)
- If you got the data from someone else, are there any constraints around using them?
- What are **three key research questions** you will ask of these data?

The purpose of this section is to determine whether the data you obtained will be sufficient for the major project. 

**Part 1 is due by the end of week 5** and should be submitted by email to the instructor.

### Total Value: 50% of course grade

# Minor Assignments

I define a minor assignment as something that takes < 1 week to complete. You will be given directions on these in class. Expect there to be two or three minor assignments, which together will be worth 20% of the course grade.
