10% of your course grade is earned by participation. Just show up, be yourself, and participate!

The remainder will be earned by completing assignments. These fall into three categories:

- Presentation on a special topic (20%)
- Major assignment (50%)
- Minor assignments (20%)

This document outlines the details and grading criteria for each assignment.

# Presentation on a special topic

TBD

## Deliverable:
Prepare a 10-15 minute presentation (plus 5-10 minutes for audience questions) that accomplishes these objectives:

1. Describe the statistical technique. What does it do? What is it for?
2. How do you assess the fit of this technique with your data? How can you tell if it worked or not?
3. Show an example of the technique used in a scientific paper
4. Demonstrate how to use the technique and interpret its results, with real or simulated data
5. Share **reproducible** R code with the class

The statistical technique should be something that does not fit within the core topics we will cover in the course

Code that is shared for this assignment must be fully reproducible, extensively commented, and contained within an R project.

## Timeline

By Week 3: Select topic. Review with instructor. Determine presentation schedule.

Starting Week 7: Present. One presenter per week.

I define a minor assignment as something that takes < 1 week to complete. You will be given directions on these in class. Expect there to be two or three minor assignments, which together will be worth 20% of the course grade.
