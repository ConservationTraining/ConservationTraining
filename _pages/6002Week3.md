We want to work seamlessly, painlessly, and in such a way that you can easily find code and data many years after completing a project.

This week, we will cover RMarkdown - a language that allows integration of text and R code. We will also cover best-practices in arranging project folders.

### Lecture Topics

* What is workflow?
* Using RProjects to organize workflow
* Best practices in arranging project folders
* Minimal Reporducible Examples
* Introduction to RMarkdown
* Introduction to Version Control (concept only)

## Code and Data

Going forward, I will include a project file for most weeks, enclosed in a .zip file. Please download the .zip file and unzip it before class starts.
* [FISH6002_Week3.zip](/assets/images/FISH6002_Week3.zip)

A sample template for 6002's major assignment. We will be building this in class - use this if you get stuck.
* [MajorPart1Sample.zip](/assets/images/MajorPart1Sample.zip)

Our Minimal Reproducible Activity file is here:
* [6002-MinimalExample1.R](/assets/images/6002-MinimalExample1.R)

And if you want to see solutions to it:
