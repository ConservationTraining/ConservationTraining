## Course Content

These slides are designed to be viewed on a computer - **not printed.** They contain hyperlinks to relevant content.

Dates below are accurate, but I will be updating slides week to week.

The rightmost column indicates if I have updated the lecture for that week. I anticipate making small tweaks to each lecture as the semester goes on - please follow along with the most up to date version.
