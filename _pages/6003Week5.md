## Feb 5-6, 2018

At this point we know how to specify, execute, and interpret output from linear models. But how do we know if they're even working?

This week we will focus on model specification - how to determine what covariates to include, and how to assess whether the model has fit your data well.

### Lecture Topics

* Intro to some terminology: Model selection and validation
* Four schools of thought on model selection:
	- Design a good experiment and keep everything in
	- Stepwise selection
	- Information theoretic approach
	- Hypothesis testing
* Reporting results of a model validation
	
### In-class Activities

As always, this class will have a mixture of R code and lecture slides

### Pre-class Prep

Please read:

[Zuur, A. F. and Ieno, E. N. (2016), A protocol for conducting and presenting results of regression-type analyses. Methods Ecol Evol, 7: 636â€“645. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12577](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12577/abstract)

Full comprehension is not expected at this stage. 

**Optional**
