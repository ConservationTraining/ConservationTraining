You've proposed the study, completed it, and published it in a top-tier journal - and now it's time to hit the conference circuit. In this lecture, you'll learn how to create captivating talks that engage the audience with your research.

### Lecture Topics

* The structure, function, and purpose of science conferences
* Types of talks - speed, regular, and plenary
* Understanding the audience
* Good science talks are stories
* Focus: Slideshows
    - Fundamentals of slide design (big text, few words, great figures)
	- Presenting graphs
    - Crafting audience-appropriate graphics

### In-class Activities

- Presenting a graph
- Preparing a three-minute proposal

## Details

### Presenting a graph

Last week, we picked out a science paper. Take one figure from that paper and turn it into a Powerpoint slide. Present items in a stepwise manner - using animations to introduce each element one by one.

Prep: 15 min
2 minutes per student

### Preparing three-minute-proposal

See the assignment guide for details. We will introduce the 3 minute proposal assignment and have some time to start preparing.
