- Poster session. Each student presents their poster via digital projector. They should do a short (~ 3 minute) overview of their proposed research (using the poster as a visual aid), and then take a maximum of three minutes to explain why they designed the poster the way they did.
- Three minute proposal rehearsal talk. Each student will deliver their draft 3 Minute Proposal. These will be filmed and provided to students, with each student given private, individual feedback from the instructor.
