# November 17, 2017

This week we continue our journey outside the ivory tower with a deep dive into writing for non-scientific audiences. We will focus on the Economist, a publication that writes very short, pithy articles about science papers.

We will also discuss another form of written communication that is very important to science - and that is the email.

### Lecture Topics
