## March 26 + 27, 2018

These lectures will represent a **brief** introduction to the topics of power analysis and Bayesian statistics. There is simply no time to go into these in any sort of detail, so the objective today will be just to familiarize yourself with the basic logic of these techniques, and where to go to learn more.

### Lecture Topics

* Power analysis: 
	- What is it?
	- Why do it?
	- How can you do it with GLMMs?
* Bayesian statistics:
	- What is it?
	- Why is it better?
	- What!? Why haven't you been teaching us this the whole time!?
	- How to do it in R?
