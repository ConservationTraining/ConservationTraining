This week we will continue with our exploration of R, and introduce the concept of Tidy Data. Our emphasis will be on importing, manuipulating, and summarizing data. 

### Lecture Topics

* Concept: Tidy data. 
  + What is it?
  + Contrast with messy data
* Clear code, named variables
* Dos: One piece of info per box
* Do not dos: Commas, colours, mixed data, and other no-nos
* Wide format vs. long-format data
* Intro to dplyr

### In-class Activities

* R Exercises:
  + Importing and summarizing data
  + Basic manipulation in the Tidyverse

## Details - Week 4

### Activities

We will look at three tables with messy data (see lecture notes) and, in groups, will redraw them by hand to be tidy. Don't worry about error correction - today is all about reshaping data. 

After that, download the sample code and data. We will run through the code and explore how it works.
