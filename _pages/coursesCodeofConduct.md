**Last revised August 23, 2017**

Research is hard, and you will spend a lot of time outside your comfort zone during your time at the Marine Institute. In return, you have the right to expect a **safe and inclusive** space.

To that end, all students, staff, and faculty associated with courses instructed by Dr. Brett Favaro are expected to comply with the following Code of Conduct, adapted from @Favaro. Note that this code is in addition to Memorial University's existing [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.mun.ca/student/sscm/conduct/).

**Expected Behaviour**

* Treat everyone with respect and consideration.
* Communicate openly and thoughtfully with others and be considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that are different than your own.
* Be respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow students and colleagues.

**Unacceptable Behaviour**

* Harassment and intimidation, including any verbal, written, or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate, or coerce another person;
* Discrimination based on gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, or culture;
* Physical or verbal abuse of any student, staff member, faculty member, or guest;
* Examples of unacceptable behavior also include, but are not limited to: inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations; threatening or stalking any participant; sexually harassing any participant; disrespectful disruption of presentations.

**Consequences and Reporting**

* Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
* If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behaviour, please immediately notify the instructor or another faculty or staff member at the Marine Institute. Alternatively, students may contact the [MUN Harassment Office](https://www.mun.ca/sexualharassment/)
* For matters of immediate physical safety, you may also approach onsite campus security.
* Memorial University's [Health and Safety policy](https://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=213) applies to all courses, as does MUN's [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=GENINFO-2504)
