## Feb 26-27, 2018

We will continue our exploration of GLMs this week, looking at how GLM's can be applied to data expressed as zeroes and ones, proportions, rates, and more.

This lecture will be a bit different than others. We will cover many topics in very brief detail. But each of these topics could be its own lecture. Consequently, I will 'name-drop' several techniques, simply state what they are and when they might be used, and encourage self-study. 

### Lecture Topics

* GLM's for data expressed as zeroes and ones, proportions, and rates
* Contrast Bernoulli, Binomial, and Beta regression
* In brief: Multinomial and cumulative logistic regression (i.e. what to do when Y is categorical)
* Simulating from the model as a validation step
		
### In-class Activities

As always, this class will have a mixture of R code and lecture slides
