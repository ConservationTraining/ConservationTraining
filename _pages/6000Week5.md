### Activity 4: Abstract-writing exercise, and peer-review

Students will be given the Nature Guide to Abstracts. Apply the colour-coding system identified in the Guide to the paper they downloaded for Activity 3. 

Using colour-coding, identify the sentences that include
  * Basic intro
  * Detailed background
  * General problem
  * Here we show...
  * Main result
  * Context
  * Broader context
  
(10 minutes)

Then, get into pairs. Read the abstracts out loud to each other and show each others' colour-coding. Discuss whether the abstracts followed the Nature structure. What was missing, if anything? What was extraneous? Were these sentences easy to identify? 

After both partners show each other their work, discuss the abstracts more generally. Were they easy to follow? Do they make you want to read the paper? 

(10 minutes total)

Any thoughts, insights, or reflections can then be shared with the class
