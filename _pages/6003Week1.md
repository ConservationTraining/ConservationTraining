## January 8-9, 2018

In these lectures we will introduce the course itself and demonstrate how it fits into the MI Fisheries Science course ecosystem. 

We will then cover some basics about statistical terminology, and review how R Projects work so we can hit the ground running next week.

*Note: We actually did this lecture on Jan 15-16

### Lecture Topics
