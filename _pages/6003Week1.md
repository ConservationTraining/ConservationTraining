In these lectures we will introduce the course itself and demonstrate how it fits into the MI Fisheries Science course ecosystem. 

We will then cover some basics about statistical terminology, and review how R Projects work so we can hit the ground running next week.

### Lecture Topics

* Introduction to the course and review of assignments
* Reviewing statistal terminology
* Reviewing basic logic of (frequentist) statistical analysis

### In-class Activities

* Determine presentation schedule for above
