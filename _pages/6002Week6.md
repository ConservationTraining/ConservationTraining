Last week we learned some basic error-checking and cleanup of dataset that contain errors.

This week, we will take a step further, and you will create a new dataset and attach it to existing data.

We will also discuss some issues that are associated with data collection - particularly fieldwork. We will discuss field safety and harassment. We will also talk about data management, and how to plan to preserve data collected during a study.

### Lecture Topics
