Publications are the fundamental unit of scientific output, but how do you go from idea to published paper? In this lecture we will explore the ecosystem of scientific publishing, and you will learn the ABC's of this complicated world.

### Lecture Topics

* What is primary literature?
    + Primary literature vs. grey literature vs. everything else
    + Peer review defines primary literature
* How scientists and journals are assessed
    + Personal metrics (e.g. citations, H-index)
    + Journal metrics (e.g. impact factor, subjective opinions)
    + Altmetrics
    + Biases can influence these metrics, so be skeptical
* Open Access vs. Subscription-based journals
    + Economics of publishers
    + Pros and cons of each model, and ethical considerations
    + When are you required to publish Open Access?
    + Avoiding predatory journals
* How to select a journal in which to publish
    + Target audience, turnaround time, cost, open access
* Authorship
