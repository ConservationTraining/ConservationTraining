#  Week 3: Proposals

Before we can do science, we have to convince someone to let us do the research. The lifecycle of most research projects begins with a proposal, and every grad student does a proposal as part of their research program. Today's lecture will focus on this critical step.

### Lecture Topics

* What are proposals for, and what types of things get proposed?
* Crafting excellent research questions
  - Intro to literture searches
* Just read the instructions! (Study the criteria of a grant, scholarship, or proposal before you start writing)
* How (and who) to ask for a reference letter
* Building support networks to increase likelihood of acceptance

### In-class Activities

*  Build a proposal (4 parts)
    - Self-brainstorm
    - Shaping research plans based on scholarship criteria
    - Developing topic sentences and tweet-length plans
    - Fleshing out the details
* Assign paper for Week 5
