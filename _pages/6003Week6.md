In fisheries and ecology, we run into many types of data. Counts are among the most common. So are densities, and 0/1 data.

In this lecture we will learn about the concept of a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and explore how they can be used to deal with the above types of data.

### Lecture Topics

* Intro to GLMs
* Poisson distributions for count data
* Negative binomial distributions for count data
* Binomial logistic regression for 0's and 1's
* Validation for each of the above
		
### In-class Activities

As always, this class will have a mixture of R code and lecture slides

### Minor Assignment 2

- Introduce Minor Assignment 2 (see [Assignment guide](/courses/6003Stats/6003Assignmentguide/))

### Pre-class Prep

Have a look at the website for the [visreg package](http://pbreheny.github.io/visreg/) - a helpful tool for visualizing model output.

**Optional**

We will use data from the below paper for one exercise. Read if you like:
